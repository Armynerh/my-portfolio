        As I embark on the exciting adventure of full-stack software development, I find myself navigating the worlds of technology and education with ease. As an enthusiastic and dynamic professional, I am now working as a freelance full-stack developer. I have engaged in 100+ hours of remote pair programming with international peers, Implemented unit and integration tests with Jest, Unittest, Pytest and RSpec, achieving 95% test coverage, developed responsive and dynamic user interfaces using React.js, Implemented server-side logic and API integrations with Ruby on Rails and Flask, and designed and maintained relational databases using SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL)

        Beyond the lines of code that I write, my story also delves into the world of teaching English as a Second Language. With a TEFL/IDP certification and more than three years of experience as an ESL/IELTS trainer, I&lsquo;ve discovered the perfect blend between linguistic refinement and technological competence.

        In terms of my career goals, I see myself not only as a programmer, but also as a future expert in tech curriculum creation and instruction. My motivation is driven by a desire to contribute to companies that are shaping the future of learning, developing digital landscapes in which information grows seamlessly.

        Beyond the computer and the classroom, I&lsquo;m usually engaged in the pages of a book, mesmerised by podcasts, studying the world through documentaries, travelling the world, or immersed in the strategic landscapes of games, every aspect of my life contributes to an ever-changing story.
        I am on a mission to illuminate the intersection between technology and education, to create a narrative that goes beyond code and classrooms.

        I love talk about the fascinating connections between technology and education. I&lsquo;m always ready to engage in conversations about coding, the latest in ReactJs, or researching potential career routes. I&lsquo;m look forward to meeting with like-minded people and exploring opportunities that match my experience. Send me a message, and let us go on this journey together!
